# password game - work in progress

The Password Game is a pet project I created to learn the React.js framework.  
Try it out -> [password game](https://password-game-blue.vercel.app/)

### Features

- checking username length
- adding conditions once the previous one is met
- sorting conditions to keep unmet ones at the top
- restoring the username from cache after a page reload
- resetting the game by clicking the logo
- handling 404 errors
- displaying the weather in the footer

### ToDo

- add tests
- drawing conditions
- animation after meeting all the conditions
- save users in database
- refactor

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

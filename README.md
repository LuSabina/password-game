# password game - work in progress
The Password Game is a pet project I created to learn the React.js framework.  
Try it out -> [password game](https://password-game-blue.vercel.app/)

### Features
- checking username length
- adding conditions after previous one is green
- sorting conditions to keep red ones at the top
- restoring username from cache after page reload
- reseting the game by click the logo

### ToDo
- add tests
- drawing conditions
- animation after meeting all the conditions
- save users in database
- refactor


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
